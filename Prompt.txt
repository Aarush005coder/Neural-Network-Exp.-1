Title: 
Visualization of Perceptron Learning Algorithm with Animated Decision Boundary

Problem Statement:
Design and implement a Perceptron Neural Network from scratch using Python to classify a linearly separable binary dataset. 
Generate a 2-dimensional synthetic dataset and train the perceptron using the step activation function. 
During training, display the intermediate values of input features, weights, and weighted sum ( 𝑤𝑇𝑥). 
Additionally, visualize the learning process by animating the evolution of the decision boundary over multiple epochs using Matplotlib.

Key Requirements:
1. Generate a binary classification dataset with two features.
2. Convert class labels into −1 and +1 for perceptron learning.
3. Implement the perceptron learning rule manually (without using built-in ML models).
4. Track and display:  Input vector 𝑋, Weight vector 𝑤, Weighted sum 𝑤𝑇𝑥.
5. Update weights using the perceptron update rule.
6. Stop training early if the model converges.

Visualize:
1. Training data points.
2. Decision boundary updates at each step.
3. Animated learning process of the perceptron.
